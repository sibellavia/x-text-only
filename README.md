# x text-only feed extension

## overview

the x text-only feed extension is a chromium-based browser extension that filters your x feed to show only text posts, links and spaces, hiding images and videos.
i made it because sometimes the feed seems overwhelming to me. it's nice to read text-only posts at will.

## features

- filters out images and videos from your x feed
- allows text posts and links to remain visible
- simple toggle button to enable/disable the text-only mode
- lightweight and easy to use
- no data collection or external dependencies

## installation

idc about chrome web store so only manual installation is available.

### manual installation

1. download or clone this repository
2. open your chromium-based browser (e.g., google chrome, microsoft edge)
3. navigate to the extensions page:
   - for chrome: go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - for edge: go to `edge://extensions/`
4. enable "developer mode" using the toggle in the top right corner
5. click "load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files

## usage

1. after installation, you'll see a new button in the top right corner of your x pages
2. by default, the extension is inactive, and your x feed will appear normally
3. to enable text-only mode, click the "enable text-only mode" button
4. to disable text-only mode and see all posts (including those with media), click the "disable text-only mode" button
5. the extension will remember your preference for the current browsing session, but will reset to disabled when you close and reopen your browser
